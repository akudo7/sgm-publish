# arXiv Search Skill

Search the arXiv preprint repository for research papers in physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, and related fields.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Find preprints and recent research papers before journal publication
- Search for papers in computational biology, bioinformatics, or systems biology
- Access mathematical or statistical methods papers relevant to biology
- Find machine learning papers applied to biological problems
- Get the latest research that may not yet be in PubMed

## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

- **MUST** use the provided `arxiv_search.ts` script via `npx tsx`. Do NOT write inline scripts.
- **DO NOT** use `python3`, `curl`, `wget`, or `web_fetch` to query arXiv directly.
- `python3` is not in the allowed command list and will fail.

## Instructions

To search arXiv for papers, follow these steps **exactly**:

1. **Identify the search query** from the user's request
2. **Determine the number of papers** to retrieve (default: 10, or as specified by user)
3. **Locate the search script** using the `glob_files` tool:
   ```
   pattern: "**/arxiv_search.ts"
   ```
   Use the first returned path as `SCRIPT_PATH`. If no file is found, report an error and stop.
4. **Execute the search script** using the `bash_command` tool:
   ```bash
   npx tsx SCRIPT_PATH "SEARCH_QUERY" --max-papers N
   ```
   Replace:
   - `SCRIPT_PATH` with the path found in step 3
   - `SEARCH_QUERY` with the actual search query (keep quotes)
   - `N` with the desired number of papers (e.g., 3, 5, 10)
5. **Parse the results** and present them to the user in a clear format

## Examples

Assuming `glob_files` returns `skills/arxiv-search/arxiv_search.ts`:

### Example 1: Search for 5 deep learning papers
```bash
npx tsx skills/arxiv-search/arxiv_search.ts "deep learning drug discovery" --max-papers 5
```

### Example 2: Search for 3 transformer papers
```bash
npx tsx skills/arxiv-search/arxiv_search.ts "transformers in natural language processing" --max-papers 3
```

### Example 3: Search for protein folding papers (default 10)
```bash
npx tsx skills/arxiv-search/arxiv_search.ts "protein folding prediction" --max-papers 10
```

## Output Format

The script returns formatted results with:

- **Title**: Paper title
- **Summary**: Abstract/summary text

Each paper is separated by blank lines for readability.

## Features

- **Relevance sorting**: Results ordered by relevance to query
- **Fast retrieval**: Direct API access with no authentication required
- **Simple interface**: Clean, easy-to-parse output
- **No API key required**: Free access to arXiv database

## Notes

- arXiv is particularly strong for:
  - Computer science (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV)
  - Quantitative biology (q-bio)
  - Statistics (stat.ML)
  - Physics and mathematics
- Papers are preprints and may not be peer-reviewed
- Results include both recent uploads and older papers
- Best for computational/theoretical work in biology

### 2026-01-01 — Example: effective search query pattern

**Observation**: Using specific category filters (cs.LG) returned more relevant results than generic terms.
**Lesson**: Always include the arXiv category code when the user specifies a field.
